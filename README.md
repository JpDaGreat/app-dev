# **INTERSTELLAR (2014)**
>
## **Directed by:** Christopher Nolan
#### I've never seen a movie so spectacular. Interstellar really blew my mind and expectation when I first watched it. The actors and actress greatness, the incredible visualization, beautiful soundtrack, the overwhelming emotion, the well thought unique ideas, effort, etc. can be seen through this movie. Even though I've watched so many movie since then, Interstellar is the only one that fascinated me especially how they introduce the "Blackhole" and the theory about it. It includes some scientists just for the closeness of the real "Terrestrial Blackhole". Kudos to Director Christopher Nolan and his team for making this movie and provididing more immediacy to it.
